notes for UI design course


Note: all the different folders should be treated as separate projects

1. White space: 
    white space is the empty space between the elements in your user interface 

2. Alignment: 
    A. where things are located on the page can make a big difference in how your page looks and overall feel. 

    B. Each element in a UI defines a series of rows and columns

3. contrast: 
    A. contrast is defined as being in a strikingly different state from something else 

    B. WCAG 2.0 contrast Guidelines:

        1. (minimum AA) the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for large text which should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

        2. (enhanced AAA) the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, except for large text which should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

you can find your contrast with various plugins 

4. scale:
    A. just as with alignment, white space, contrast, and the other fundamentals, the size of ever UI element must be carefully considered.

5. Typograpghy
    A. good typograpgy requires the understanding of other fundamentals, along with a few special considerations. 
        1. font choices 
        2. visual hierarchy 
        3. font size 
        4. alignment 
        5. letter spacing and light height 
        6. font styles 
        7. color and contrast 

6. Color: 
    A. the first UI design fundamental that shapes a users experience is color 

7. Visual Hierarchy 
    A. Every element on a user interface has a level of importance. Some elements are more important than others. Visual hierarchy is how we establish this importance.
