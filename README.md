# Algorithm Learning

## Welcome
This is a repository designed to help me learn the processes and techniques for learning and understanding the workings of all sorts of different algorithms. If you are on a journey to get better at solving algorithms please take a look at the work I have done. In the different sections you will find my solutions to some popular algorithms. After I have solved a problem I try to find a better solution by someone else. OK maybe not better but different to learn the different ways to solve problems and the different methods involved. I hope you enjoy !!!!!
